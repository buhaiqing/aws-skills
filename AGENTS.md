# AGENTS.md

Repo-specific guidance for OpenCode/AI agents. Read `CLAUDE.md` first for the
shared baseline (architecture, credential convention, dual-path execution,
safety gates, error-recovery table). This file only records things an agent
would otherwise get wrong.

## What this repo is

A flat collection of AI-Agent runbooks for AWS services. Every top-level
`aws-<service>-ops/` directory is a *skill*, not source code. There is no
build, no lint, no test runner, no CI. "Editing the codebase" means editing
Markdown skill files and the YAML/JSON assets they ship.

There is exactly one meta-skill, `aws-skill-generator/`, that scaffolds and
governs all `aws-<service>-ops/` skills. Treat it as the source of truth for
structure, frontmatter, and review rules.

## Source-of-truth files (read these before editing skills)

- `aws-skill-generator/SKILL.md` — generation process, Charter (C1–C6),
  Token Efficiency rules (TE-1…TE-6).
- `aws-skill-generator/references/aws-skill-template.md` — required SKILL.md
  skeleton (frontmatter + section order).
- `aws-skill-generator/references/governance-review.md` — pre-merge
  checklist and adversarial scenarios (A–H). Skills failing C1–C6 or H1–H6
  must be auto-fixed, not merged.
- `aws-skill-generator/references/aws-cli-conventions.md`,
  `boto3-sdk-usage.md`, `integration.md` — shared conventions; individual
  skills reference these instead of duplicating.

## Skill layout (must match exactly)

```
aws-<service>-ops/
  SKILL.md                 # ~70–120 lines, "what to do" only
  references/
    aws-cli-usage.md       # CLI commands + JSON paths (verified)
    boto3-sdk-usage.md     # SDK patterns (no docstrings — TE-2)
    core-concepts.md       # Service architecture, quotas
    troubleshooting.md     # Compact error table (TE-3)
  assets/                  # example-config.yaml, dashboards, etc.
```

`prompt-examples.md`, `cost-tracking.md`, `escalation.md`,
`aiops-automation-engine.md` are optional extensions used by mature skills
(e.g. `aws-elb-ops`). Do not invent new file names without updating
`aws-skill-template.md` and the README.

## SKILL.md frontmatter gotcha (fixed — aws-ec2-ops verified clean 2026-07-12)

YAML frontmatter is a **single** block delimited by one opening and one
closing `---`. Previously, `aws-ec2-ops/SKILL.md` accidentally split the
block (a stray `---` after the `description` value), which broke
frontmatter parsers. This has been verified clean as of 2026-07-12.

When you create or edit a SKILL.md:

- Exactly two `---` markers, both at the start of the file.
- `description: >-` folded scalars must end with a blank line, **not** a
  `---` line.
- After editing frontmatter, verify with:
  `awk '/^---$/{c++; if(c==2){exit}} c==1' SKILL.md` returns the whole
  frontmatter block, and `head -1` is `---`.

## Mandatory sections in every SKILL.md

Enforced by Charter C1–C6 (see `governance-review.md`). Missing any of these
means the skill is invalid and must be auto-fixed:

1. YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility`,
   `metadata`.
2. `## Trigger & Scope` with both `### SHOULD Use When` and
   `### SHOULD NOT Use When` (delegate names must point to skills that
   actually exist in this repo).
3. `## Variable Convention` table using only `{{env.*}}`, `{{user.*}}`,
   `{{output.*}}` placeholders. Never instruct the user to paste secrets;
   `{{env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}}` / `{{env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}}` must fail
   closed if unset.
4. Execution flow per operation: **Pre-flight → Execute → Validate → Recover**.
5. Explicit human confirmation step before any destructive op (delete,
   terminate, deregister, detach).
6. Token Efficiency (TE-1…TE-6): no hardcoded version/port/state tables,
   no SDK docstrings, compact error tables, JSON paths declared once at
   file top, YAML anchors in `example-config.yaml`, no duplicated flows
   across SKILL.md and references.

## Repo conventions worth knowing

- Always invoke CLI with `--output json`; assets and references assume
  JSON output so agents can `jq` paths.
- CLI is primary, boto3 is fallback after 3 CLI failures (CLAUDE.md).
- Credentials load order (highest first): shell env → `.env` → defaults.
  `.env` is git-ignored; `.env.example` is the template.
- `README.md` and `README_cn.md` must be kept in sync when adding,
  removing, or version-bumping a skill (the "Existing Skills" table and
  the AIOps section both reference per-skill versions). **Verify after
  every version bump:**
  ```bash
  for d in aws-*-ops; do
    v=$(grep -m1 'version:' "$d/SKILL.md" | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '"');
    grep -q "$v" README.md README_cn.md || echo "MISMATCH: $d=$v";
  done
  ```
  Empty output = all synced. Alternatively, the CI workflow
  `.github/workflows/version-sync.yml` auto-fixes mismatches and opens a PR
  on push to `main`.
- `.omc/` holds OpenCode session state and project memory — do not commit
  changes there as part of skill edits.

## Operational Guidelines (agent workflow)

### Task Tracking for Multi-Step Work

For any work involving 3+ distinct steps, create tasks via `TaskCreate`
before starting. This provides:
- Progress visibility to the user
- A checklist that prevents skipping steps
- A natural "next task" prompt when the user says "继续"

After completing each task, immediately mark it `completed` and check
`TaskList` for the next item. Do not batch completions.

### GCL Skip Threshold

GCL (Generator-Critic-Loop) is required for >5 line code changes,
but can be skipped for:
- Single-line constant additions (e.g., adding a metric to a dict)
- Import list updates (e.g., expanding `__init__.py` exports)
- Documentation-only changes (adding notes, clarifying existing text)

The判断标准: if the change is purely additive (no logic changes,
no control flow, no error handling), GCL overhead exceeds its value.

### Pre-existing Lint Baseline

When running `ruff check` / `eslint` after changes, always run the
linter on the **entire file** first to establish which errors are
pre-existing. Only errors on **new or modified lines** count as
regressions. Report pre-existing errors separately if the user asks
for a full lint report.

This prevents false-positive code reviews where the reviewer flags
errors that existed before the change.

## Self-reflection rule (project policy)

> **Rule**: After every skill update, auto-run **2 rounds** of self-review
> and fix all discovered issues. Do not hand back to the user between rounds.
>
> Full spec (check tables, verification scripts, dedup procedures,
> implementation notes) at
> [`docs/post-update-self-review.md`](docs/post-update-self-review.md)

| Round | Scope | Key Checks |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **R1: Structural** | Frontmatter / Trigger / Variables / Token Efficiency | C1–C6, TE-1…TE-6, **C6 MUST PASS** |
| **R2: Content** | CLI validation / error codes / safety gates / link integrity / dedup / TODO.md sync | F1–F8, **F5/F6/F8 MUST PASS** |

Each round, for every modified skill:

1. Re-read the modified SKILL.md from disk (do not trust memory).
2. **Verify Charter C1–C6** (see `governance-review.md`). Failure →
   report `[CHARTER VIOLATION] C{n}: {reason}` and auto-fix.
3. **Verify Token Efficiency TE-1…TE-6** per `aws-skill-generator/SKILL.md`.
   C6 is a MUST PASS gate — see [post-update-self-review.md](docs/post-update-self-review.md) §TE verification.
4. **Verify frontmatter** parses (single `---` open + close, see §frontmatter gotcha).
5. **Verify delegation references** — every `aws-<x>-ops` in SHOULD/SHOULD NOT
   or recovery tables must point to an existing directory.
6. **Verify destructive ops** (`delete`, `terminate`, `detach`, `revoke`)
   each have explicit confirmation in pre-flight.
7. **Verify JSON paths** match `references/aws-cli-usage.md` and the
   centralized "Common JSON Paths" block at SKILL.md top.
8. **Verify README sync** — `README.md` and `README_cn.md` tables reflect state.
9. **TE Post-Change Audit** — scan references/ for token waste per
   [post-update-self-review.md](docs/post-update-self-review.md) §Content Deduplication.

After round 2 passes cleanly, report a one-line summary per modified
skill: `[OK] aws-<service>-ops v<version> — 2 rounds clean`.

If round 2 still finds issues, run additional rounds until clean. Do
**not** stop after 2 rounds if problems remain.

### Reflexion Memory (cross-session learning)

Failed operations leave structured failure patterns in
[`docs/failure-patterns.md`](docs/failure-patterns.md). Before executing any
high-risk operation, the agent MUST check this file for known failure modes
of the target resource type. Each pattern records:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `resource_type` | Which AWS resource (e.g., `aws-rds-db-instance`) |
| `failure_mode` | What went wrong (e.g., `final-snapshot-skip-in-prod`) |
| `root_cause` | Why it happened |
| `fix` | What the agent should do differently |
| `severity` | `P0` (block) / `P1` (warn) / `P2` (info) |
| `added_date` | When the pattern was recorded |

Patterns are appended after every GCL `SAFETY_FAIL` or `MAX_ITER` with
unresolved safety issues. The agent treats these as **hard constraints** —
not suggestions — when planning or executing operations.

## When the user asks for a new AWS skill

Load `aws-skill-generator` first, then collect the inputs listed under
"Quick Start Checklist → P0" in its SKILL.md before generating any
files. The directory you create must mirror the layout above exactly,
and the generated SKILL.md must pass the Charter and TE rules on the
first round of self-reflection — if it does not, fix the generator
output, not just the symptom in the new skill.

## 11. Generator-Critic-Loop (GCL) — Adversarial Quality Gate

> Inspired by GAN's Generator/Discriminator idea, but deliberately **not** a
> real GAN. Naming: **GCL (Generator-Critic-Loop)** to avoid misleading
> reviewers and LLM trainees.

### 11.1 Purpose

Apply an adversarial **Generator ↔ Critic** loop with a quantitative rubric
to every skill execution. Most valuable in **high-side-effect AWS
operations** (`terminate-instances`, `delete-bucket`, `delete-db-instance`,
`iam delete-user`, `kms schedule-key-deletion`, etc.) where a single
mistake is unrecoverable.

The full specification lives in
[`aws-skill-generator/references/gcl-spec.md`](aws-skill-generator/references/gcl-spec.md).
This section is the **index, current rollout status, and Per-Skill
Defaults table** — read it first, then load the spec for detail.

| GAN (real) | GCL (this spec) |
|---|---|
| Discriminator learns sample distribution | Critic scores an **explicit rubric** |
| No termination condition | Must terminate: **PASS / MAX_ITER / SAFETY_FAIL** |
| G and D train in parallel | G and C run **sequentially** |
| Goal: "fool the D" | Goal: "pass the rubric threshold" |

### 11.2 Roles & isolation

| Role | Job | Forbidden |
|---|---|---|
| **Generator (G)** | Execute the AWS op via `aws --output json` (primary) / boto3 (fallback) | modifying the rubric; self-scoring |
| **Critic (C)** | Independently audit G's output against the rubric | calling `aws` / `boto3` / mutating anything |
| **Orchestrator (O)** | Loop control, termination, final return | executing or scoring on its own |

G and C MUST live in **isolated prompt contexts** (separate sessions or
sub-agents). Shared context is a "pseudo-GCL" and is banned — see spec §9.

### 11.3 Rubric (mandatory per skill)

Each skill declares its 5-dimension rubric in `references/rubric.md`:
**Correctness / Safety / Idempotency / Traceability / Spec Compliance** on
a 0 / 0.5 / 1 scale. **Safety = 0 → ABORT immediately**, regardless of
total score. Full rules in spec §3.

### 11.4 Termination (first match wins)

| Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **PASS** | Every rubric dimension meets its threshold → return G's result |
| **MAX_ITER** | Reached `max_iterations` → return **best-so-far** + unresolved rubric items |
| **SAFETY_FAIL** | Safety = 0 → **ABORT**; never return partial output |

### 11.5 Per-Skill Defaults

Each skill may override its own `max_iter` in its `SKILL.md` under
`## Quality Gate (GCL)`. A skill not yet listed has GCL **disabled** by
default — pilots are rolled out one at a time per the spec §10 roadmap.

### 11.6 Trace & audit (mandatory)

Every GCL run persists a JSON trace to
`./audit-results/gcl-trace-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json` per the schema in spec §6.
`audit-results/` is git-ignored; traces retained 30 days; old traces pruned
by the Phase 2 Orchestrator runner.

### 11.7 Prompt templates (mandatory per skill)

Each skill's `references/prompt-templates.md` is a **thin specialization**
of the canonical shared skeleton at
[`references/prompt-skeletons.md`](aws-skill-generator/references/prompt-skeletons.md)
(spec §7). The per-skill file contains ONLY:

1. Skill metadata table (`{{skill.*}}` placeholders)
2. Hard rules (Critic template injection) — one bullet per
   service-specific rule, each citing a `gcl-spec.md` §8 A-id (A1–A16)
3. Confirmation Strings table — mandatory for every destructive op
4. Variable Convention deltas — only entries unique to this skill

The three canonical templates (Generator / Critic / Orchestrator) are
resolved from the shared skeleton at runtime by
`scripts/gcl_runner.py` via `render_critic_prompt()`. Placeholders MUST
follow the repository-wide `{{env.*}}` / `{{user.*}}` / `{{output.*}}`
convention. Critic prompt MUST hide the raw user request to prevent
"answer-aligned" rubber-stamping. New skill creators MUST use the
[`assets/new-skill-template/prompt-templates.md`](aws-skill-generator/assets/new-skill-template/prompt-templates.md)
copy-paste template; run `--dry-run` before merging.

### 11.8 Anti-patterns (banned)

- ❌ **Shared context G+C** — defeats independence → banned
- ❌ **Subjective scoring** — Critic must use the rubric, not "vibes" → banned
- ❌ **Unbounded loop** — always hard-cap iterations → banned
- ❌ **Critic sees the user request** — encourages rubber-stamping → banned
- ❌ **Silently downgrade on Safety fail** — must ABORT visibly → banned
- ❌ **Trace not persisted** — no post-mortem possible → banned
- ❌ **Critic mutates resources** — Critic is read-only by definition → banned
- ❌ **`aws --output json` placed before subcommand** — non-portable;
  convention is `aws <svc> <op> --output json` (see CLAUDE.md) → banned
  in GCL traces and examples
- ❌ **Parallel GCL: Generators share mutable state** — race conditions → banned
- ❌ **Parallel GCL: Generators modify the same file** — merge conflicts → banned
- ❌ **Parallel GCL: Critic audits only one Generator output** — must audit ALL

### 11.9 AWS-specific rules (repo-wide)

Codified in `gcl-spec.md` §8. Highlights:

- **A1** `terminate-instances` requires user `--no-dry-run` opt-in
- **A7** `--region` must match `{{user.region}}` or `{{env.AWS_DEFAULT_REGION}}`
- **A8** Resource id must be echoed back from a `describe-*` lookup
- **A9** Plaintext `KeyMaterial` / `PasswordData` / `UserData` credentials
  in trace → Safety = 0; mask with `***` and length only
- **A10** `aws sts get-caller-identity` MUST be the first command in trace
- **A11** `cloudfront delete-distribution` must `disable → poll Deployed` first
- **A12** `elbv2 deregister-targets` ≥50% → requires drain confirmation
- **A13** `ec2 delete-vpc` requires 8-describe pre-flight
- **A14** `rds --skip-final-snapshot` → requires `DELETE_NO_SNAPSHOT` token
- **A15** `s3 put-bucket-policy` widening to `Principal: *` → requires public confirmation
- **A16** `autoscaling --force-delete` with `DesiredCapacity > 0` → must scale-to-0 first

### 11.10 Rollout roadmap

- **Phase 1 (in progress)** — spec + this index shipped; pilots on
  **`aws-ec2-ops`** (compute, destructive workload),
  **`aws-iam-ops`** (identity, secret-handling + wildcard-policy guards),
  **`aws-kms-ops`** (encryption, irreversible deletion + plaintext
  masking), and **`aws-s3-ops`** (storage, Versioned-bucket guard +
  public-access widening + `--recursive` rm count confirmation). Roll
  forward to remaining `required` skills one at a time (see §11.5 table).
- **Phase 2** — add `scripts/gcl_runner.py` as a reusable Orchestrator
  (invokes G, then C in isolated context, persists trace, enforces
  termination). Independent of any specific agent runtime.
- **Phase 3** — feed `gcl-trace-*.json` into a CloudWatch dashboard /
  Athena query for Quality Gate pass-rate and per-skill failure-mode
  histograms.
- **Phase 4** — wire rubric pass-rate to CloudWatch Alarms; production
  incidents refine thresholds.

| 1.8.0 | 2026-06-12 | Added 5 skills to §11.5 Per-Skill Defaults table (back-filled from Groups 6–7 GCL rollout): **`aws-athena-ops`** (required, max_iter=2), **`aws-guardduty-ops`** (required, max_iter=2), **`aws-opensearch-ops`** (required, max_iter=2), **`aws-ram-ops`** (required, max_iter=2), **`aws-securityhub-ops`** (required, max_iter=2) — all shipped with rubric.md and prompt-templates.md. |
| 1.9.0 | 2026-06-13 | New skill — **`aws-aurora-ops`** (v1.0.0→**v1.1.0** AIOps): orchestrator delegate contract, 8 prompt scenarios, layered inspection, AIOps metrics CLI, cross-skill chains; **`aws-rds-ops`** delegates Aurora failover; **`aws-aiops-cruise`** / **`aws-aiops-orchestrator`** route Aurora cluster ops here. |
| 1.10.0 | 2026-06-13 | **`aws-aurora-ops`** v1.2.0 P2: orchestrator runbooks RB-023–RB-027, detection rules FD-15/16 PD-08/09, `incident-schema` v1.1.0 Aurora/`RDSProxy` resource types + examples. |
| 1.11.0 | 2026-06-27 | **GCL hardening pass.** (a) Migrated 22 skill `prompt-templates.md` files to route `{{user.region}}` → `{{output.requested_region}}` and `{{user.safety_confirm}}` → `{{output.safety_confirm_token}}` inside the Critic section, eliminating the rubber-stamp vector (`gcl-spec.md` §9 anti-pattern); added §7.1 to `gcl-spec.md` documenting the placeholder mapping. (b) Shipped `scripts/gcl_runner.py` (Phase 2 reusable Orchestrator: §4 loop, §5 termination, §6 trace schema, 30-day prune, `--self-test` mode for unit verification). (c) `aws-guardduty-ops` rubric migrated from continuous 1.0/0.8/0.7 weights to spec-mandated 0/0.5/1 discrete scale + explicit ABORT-on-Safety-0 clause; `aws-guardduty-ops` prompt templates migrated from bare `{{cli_command}}` / `{{boto3_code}}` / `{{generator_output}}` to spec-compliant `{{output.*}}` namespaces. (d) `aws-iam-ops` rubric now explicitly references rules **A3** / **A7** / **A8** / **A9** / **A10** by id; `aws-vpc-ops` rubric added A9 (`UserData` / `KeyMaterial` masking) clause. (e) `gcl-spec.md` changelog extended to v1.11.0; "22 skills" references corrected to the actual 31-skill scope (28 required/recommended + 2 meta read-only + 1 generator meta). |
| 1.12.0 | 2026-06-27 | **O1 (A11–A16) + O3 (prompt-skeleton extraction) + `--print-critic` runtime.** `gcl-spec.md` §8 gained six new repo-wide safety rules: **A11** (CloudFront distribution delete requires disable→Deployed first), **A12** (ELB `deregister-targets` 50%/100% drain confirmation), **A13** (VPC `delete-vpc` 8-describe pre-flight), **A14** (RDS/Aurora `--skip-final-snapshot` guard, supersedes legacy A5 in `aws-aurora-ops`), **A15** (S3 `Principal: *` policy widening), **A16** (ASG `--force-delete` requires scale-to-0 + `InstanceProtection=false`). Backfilled A-id labels into the 7 affected rubrics (cloudfront/elb/vpc/rds/aurora/s3/autoscaling). Created `aws-skill-generator/references/prompt-skeletons.md` (canonical Generator/Critic/Orchestrator templates + shared Variable Convention table; 231 lines). New `scripts/_sync_prompt_skeletons.py` retro-migrated all 31 skill `prompt-templates.md` files from ~5,800 lines of duplicated boilerplate to **~2,200 lines of thin deltas (-78%)**; idempotent; supports `--skill <name>`, `--all`, `--dry-run`, `--restore`. `scripts/gcl_runner.py` now exposes `render_critic_prompt()` + `--print-critic` for inspecting the merged Critic prompt at runtime. All three termination paths (PASS / SAFETY_FAIL / MAX_ITER) verified end-to-end via `--self-test` after migration. Net repo diff vs pre-v1.11.0: 48 files changed, **-3,456 lines**. |
| 1.13.0 | 2026-06-27 | **§11.7 updated to reflect shared skeleton architecture (prompt-templates.md is now a thin specialization, not self-contained) + §11.9 extended with A11–A16 highlights + §11.5 Per-Skill Defaults table annotated with A-rules for 7 skills (cloudfront/elb/vpc/rds/aurora/s3/autoscaling). New copy-paste template at `aws-skill-generator/assets/new-skill-template/prompt-templates.md` for new skill creators.** |
| 1.14.0 | 2026-07-04 | **Parallel GCL added (§12 in gcl-spec.md).** Documents the multi-Generator + single-Critic pattern for composite tasks that decompose into independent subtasks (e.g., WAF-ALB-01). Includes flow diagram, 5 rules, 4 anti-patterns, and worked example. Applicable to `aws-aiops-cruise` and `aws-aiops-orchestrator` composite rule development. |

## 12. CodeGraph Integration（代码知识图谱集成）

本地优先的代码知识图谱工具（[colbymchenry/codegraph](https://github.com/colbymchenry/codegraph)，已装 `/Users/bohaiqing/.local/bin/codegraph`，Node v22.19.0）。用 tree-sitter 建本地 SQLite 图谱（`.codegraph/codegraph.db`），通过 MCP（工具 `codegraph_explore` / `codegraph_node`）集成进 OpenCode。100% 本地、无数据外泄。

### 目的

编辑技能 `SKILL.md` / `references/` 或共享脚本（`scripts/gcl_runner.py`、`_shared.py` 等）前，用 CodeGraph 校验**跨技能引用一致性**与**变更影响半径**，补强 §Operational Guidelines 的"跨文件引用三方同步"规则。

本仓库 34 个 `aws-<svc>-ops` 技能委托引用频繁（如 `aws-rds-ops`→`aws-aurora-ops`、`aws-elb-ops`↔`aws-vpc-ops`），改一处可能影响多处。`codegraph explore "aws-aurora-ops"` 实测返回 36 符号跨 3 文件 + blast radius（`run_aws` 有 61 调用者跨 15+ 文件）。

### 命令

```bash
codegraph init .              # 首次建图（实测 564 nodes / 1,329 edges）
codegraph explore "<symbol>"  # 查影响半径 / 跨文件调用点
codegraph status              # 查索引状态（Files/Nodes/Edges/DB Size）
codegraph install --target opencode   # 接 OpenCode MCP（写全局 ~/.config/opencode/）
```

MCP 启用亦可手动在 `~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc` 的 `mcp` 下加：
`"codegraph": { "type": "local", "command": ["codegraph","serve","--mcp"], "enabled": true }`。
CLI 等价命令（`codegraph explore` / `codegraph node`）始终可用，无需 MCP 即可查询。

### 规则

| 项 | 要求 |
|----|------|
| `.codegraph/` | 内容已被其自带 `.gitignore`（`*` + `!.gitignore`）屏蔽，禁止提交索引；根 `.gitignore` 可补 `.codegraph/`（可选，为 `git status` 静默） |
| 改共享脚本 / 委派引用前 | 先 `codegraph explore "<symbol>"` 确认调用点与文档描述一致 |
| GCL 任务 R2 内容评审 | 用 CodeGraph 辅助校验跨技能委托引用存在性（如 `SHOULD` / `SHOULD NOT` 指向的目录真实存在） |
| 与 self-review 关系 | 不替代 2-round self-review，仅作跨技能引用的机器校验增强 |

有 `.codegraph/` 时优先用 CodeGraph 而非 `grep` / `find` 做跨文件引用查询。索引为本地产物，重建即用 `codegraph init .`。


## Changelog

| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| 2026-07-04 | Added §Operational Guidelines: Task Tracking, GCL Skip Threshold, Pre-existing Lint Baseline |
| 2026-07-11 | Added §12 CodeGraph Integration: local code knowledge graph (colbymchenry/codegraph) for cross-skill reference consistency + blast-radius checks; `codegraph init .` indexed 564 nodes / 1,329 edges |

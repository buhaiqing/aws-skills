# AGENTS.md

Repo-specific guidance for OpenCode/AI agents. Read `CLAUDE.md` first for the
shared baseline (architecture, credential convention, dual-path execution,
safety gates, error-recovery table). This file only records things an agent
would otherwise get wrong.

## What this repo is

A flat collection of AI-Agent runbooks for AWS services. Every top-level
`aws-<service>-ops/` directory is a *skill*, not source code. There is no
build, no lint, no test runner, no CI. "Editing the codebase" means editing
Markdown skill files and the YAML/JSON assets they ship.

There is exactly one meta-skill, `aws-skill-generator/`, that scaffolds and
governs all `aws-<service>-ops/` skills. Treat it as the source of truth for
structure, frontmatter, and review rules.

## Source-of-truth files (read these before editing skills)

- `aws-skill-generator/SKILL.md` — generation process, Charter (C1–C6),
  Token Efficiency rules (TE-1…TE-6).
- `aws-skill-generator/references/aws-skill-template.md` — required SKILL.md
  skeleton (frontmatter + section order).
- `aws-skill-generator/references/governance-review.md` — pre-merge
  checklist and adversarial scenarios (A–H). Skills failing C1–C6 or H1–H6
  must be auto-fixed, not merged.
- `aws-skill-generator/references/aws-cli-conventions.md`,
  `boto3-sdk-usage.md`, `integration.md` — shared conventions; individual
  skills reference these instead of duplicating.

## Skill layout (must match exactly)

```
aws-<service>-ops/
  SKILL.md                 # ~70–120 lines, "what to do" only
  references/
    aws-cli-usage.md       # CLI commands + JSON paths (verified)
    boto3-sdk-usage.md     # SDK patterns (no docstrings — TE-2)
    core-concepts.md       # Service architecture, quotas
    troubleshooting.md     # Compact error table (TE-3)
  assets/                  # example-config.yaml, dashboards, etc.
```

`prompt-examples.md`, `cost-tracking.md`, `escalation.md`,
`aiops-automation-engine.md` are optional extensions used by mature skills
(e.g. `aws-elb-ops`). Do not invent new file names without updating
`aws-skill-template.md` and the README.

## SKILL.md frontmatter gotcha (fixed — aws-ec2-ops verified clean 2026-07-12)

YAML frontmatter is a **single** block delimited by one opening and one
closing `---`. Previously, `aws-ec2-ops/SKILL.md` accidentally split the
block (a stray `---` after the `description` value), which broke
frontmatter parsers. This has been verified clean as of 2026-07-12.

When you create or edit a SKILL.md:

- Exactly two `---` markers, both at the start of the file.
- `description: >-` folded scalars must end with a blank line, **not** a
  `---` line.
- After editing frontmatter, verify with:
  `awk '/^---$/{c++; if(c==2){exit}} c==1' SKILL.md` returns the whole
  frontmatter block, and `head -1` is `---`.

## Mandatory sections in every SKILL.md

Enforced by Charter C1–C6 (see `governance-review.md`). Missing any of these
means the skill is invalid and must be auto-fixed:

1. YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility`,
   `metadata`.
2. `## Trigger & Scope` with both `### SHOULD Use When` and
   `### SHOULD NOT Use When` (delegate names must point to skills that
   actually exist in this repo).
3. `## Variable Convention` table using only `{{env.*}}`, `{{user.*}}`,
   `{{output.*}}` placeholders. Never instruct the user to paste secrets;
   `{{env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}}` / `{{env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}}` must fail
   closed if unset.
4. Execution flow per operation: **Pre-flight → Execute → Validate → Recover**.
5. Explicit human confirmation step before any destructive op (delete,
   terminate, deregister, detach).
6. Token Efficiency (TE-1…TE-6): no hardcoded version/port/state tables,
   no SDK docstrings, compact error tables, JSON paths declared once at
   file top, YAML anchors in `example-config.yaml`, no duplicated flows
   across SKILL.md and references.

## Repo conventions worth knowing

- Always invoke CLI with `--output json`; assets and references assume
  JSON output so agents can `jq` paths.
- CLI is primary, boto3 is fallback after 3 CLI failures (CLAUDE.md).
- Credentials load order (highest first): shell env → `.env` → defaults.
  `.env` is git-ignored; `.env.example` is the template.
- `README.md` and `README_cn.md` must be kept in sync when adding,
  removing, or version-bumping a skill (the "Existing Skills" table and
  the AIOps section both reference per-skill versions). **Verify after
  every version bump:**
  ```bash
  for d in aws-*-ops; do
    v=$(grep -m1 'version:' "$d/SKILL.md" | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '"');
    grep -q "$v" README.md README_cn.md || echo "MISMATCH: $d=$v";
  done
  ```
  Empty output = all synced. Alternatively, the CI workflow
  `.github/workflows/version-sync.yml` auto-fixes mismatches and opens a PR
  on push to `main`.
- `.omc/` holds OpenCode session state and project memory — do not commit
  changes there as part of skill edits.

## Operational Guidelines (agent workflow)

### Task Tracking for Multi-Step Work

For any work involving 3+ distinct steps, create tasks via `TaskCreate`
before starting. This provides:
- Progress visibility to the user
- A checklist that prevents skipping steps
- A natural "next task" prompt when the user says "继续"

After completing each task, immediately mark it `completed` and check
`TaskList` for the next item. Do not batch completions.

### GCL Skip Threshold

GCL (Generator-Critic-Loop) is required for >5 line code changes,
but can be skipped for:
- Single-line constant additions (e.g., adding a metric to a dict)
- Import list updates (e.g., expanding `__init__.py` exports)
- Documentation-only changes (adding notes, clarifying existing text)

The判断标准: if the change is purely additive (no logic changes,
no control flow, no error handling), GCL overhead exceeds its value.

### Pre-change CodeGraph Sync (mandatory)

**Every code change must run `codegraph sync .` first** to refresh the
local index before editing. This guarantees that `codegraph explore` /
`codegraph impact` queries during the change reflect current state, so
cross-skill reference drift and blast radius are caught early.

```bash
codegraph sync .    # incremental sync; if no index exists, run codegraph init . first
```

- For documentation-only Markdown changes, sync is still recommended (cheap,
  keeps the graph current) but not strictly required.
- Full setup and rules: see §12 CodeGraph Integration.

### Pre-existing Lint Baseline

When running `ruff check` / `eslint` after changes, always run the
linter on the **entire file** first to establish which errors are
pre-existing. Only errors on **new or modified lines** count as
regressions. Report pre-existing errors separately if the user asks
for a full lint report.

This prevents false-positive code reviews where the reviewer flags
errors that existed before the change.

### Spec + Plan Before Implement (mandatory)

Any non-trivial implementation MUST first define a **spec** and a **plan**
under `docs/superpowers/` before writing code:

- **Spec** → `docs/superpowers/specs/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<topic>-design.md`
  (gap/need analysis with disk-verified evidence, scope boundary).
- **Plan** → `docs/superpowers/plans/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<topic>.md`
  (checkbox tasks referencing the spec, with acceptance criteria).

**Triggers** (any one ⇒ spec + plan required): code/config/skill change
>5 lines; new feature module; cross-file or cross-skill refactor.
**Exempt**: pure-doc typo fixes, single-line constant additions, import
list updates (purely additive, no logic/control-flow change).
**Precedent**: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-11-level3-coverage-design.md`
and its plan are the canonical template — every new implement task follows
the same path.

### Per-Phase / Milestone Full Review (mandatory)

After **all tasks in a Phase (or Milestone)** complete, run one **full
review** and **fix every issue found** before proceeding or handing off.
Cover: (1) structure — markdown tables/fences closed, headings coherent;
(2) consistency — no conflict with §11 GCL / §12 CodeGraph / §14 TE gate,
paths align with the level3 precedent; (3) scope — `git diff --stat` shows
only intended files; (4) gate — line count under §14 soft cap, frontmatter
valid. Fix each finding, re-run the check until zero issues. Unfixable
residue must be recorded and escalated for human decision — never ignored.
Record the review conclusion (scope / found / fixed / residue) before
marking the Phase done.

### Composite / Copilot Skills (L2)

Base skills (`aws-<svc>-ops`, L1) are single-service runbooks. Composite
skills (L2, `metadata.type: composite`) **orchestrate only** — they declare
`delegate:` to L1 skills and contain no service-level operation logic.

Contract (enforced by aws-skill-generator Charter C7):
- `metadata.type`: `base` | `composite` (既有等价值 `orchestrator-meta` 亦视为 composite)
- `metadata.provides`: operations this skill handles
- `metadata.delegate`: composite→base skill/operation map (dirs must exist)

Runtime-agnostic: any agent globs `aws-*-ops/SKILL.md` and reads frontmatter
— no per-agent loader (see §12 CodeGraph for cross-agent MCP discovery).

## Self-reflection rule (project policy)

> **Rule**: After every skill update, auto-run **2 rounds** of self-review
> and fix all discovered issues. Do not hand back to the user between rounds.
>
> Full spec (check tables, verification scripts, dedup procedures,
> implementation notes) at
> [`docs/post-update-self-review.md`](docs/post-update-self-review.md)

| Round | Scope | Key Checks |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **R1: Structural** | Frontmatter / Trigger / Variables / Token Efficiency | C1–C6, TE-1…TE-6, **C6 MUST PASS** |
| **R2: Content** | CLI validation / error codes / safety gates / link integrity / dedup / TODO.md sync | F1–F8, **F5/F6/F8 MUST PASS** |

Each round, for every modified skill:

1. Re-read the modified SKILL.md from disk (do not trust memory).
2. **Verify Charter C1–C6** (see `governance-review.md`). Failure →
   report `[CHARTER VIOLATION] C{n}: {reason}` and auto-fix.
3. **Verify Token Efficiency TE-1…TE-6** per `aws-skill-generator/SKILL.md`.
   C6 is a MUST PASS gate — see [post-update-self-review.md](docs/post-update-self-review.md) §TE verification.
4. **Verify frontmatter** parses (single `---` open + close, see §frontmatter gotcha).
5. **Verify delegation references** — every `aws-<x>-ops` in SHOULD/SHOULD NOT
   or recovery tables must point to an existing directory.
6. **Verify destructive ops** (`delete`, `terminate`, `detach`, `revoke`)
   each have explicit confirmation in pre-flight.
7. **Verify JSON paths** match `references/aws-cli-usage.md` and the
   centralized "Common JSON Paths" block at SKILL.md top.
8. **Verify README sync** — `README.md` and `README_cn.md` tables reflect state.
9. **TE Post-Change Audit** — scan references/ for token waste per
   [post-update-self-review.md](docs/post-update-self-review.md) §Content Deduplication.

After round 2 passes cleanly, report a one-line summary per modified
skill: `[OK] aws-<service>-ops v<version> — 2 rounds clean`.

If round 2 still finds issues, run additional rounds until clean. Do
**not** stop after 2 rounds if problems remain.

### Reflexion Memory (cross-session learning)

Failed operations leave structured failure patterns in
[`docs/failure-patterns.md`](docs/failure-patterns.md). Before executing any
high-risk operation, the agent MUST check this file for known failure modes
of the target resource type. Each pattern records:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `resource_type` | Which AWS resource (e.g., `aws-rds-db-instance`) |
| `failure_mode` | What went wrong (e.g., `final-snapshot-skip-in-prod`) |
| `root_cause` | Why it happened |
| `fix` | What the agent should do differently |
| `severity` | `P0` (block) / `P1` (warn) / `P2` (info) |
| `added_date` | When the pattern was recorded |

Patterns are appended after every GCL `SAFETY_FAIL` or `MAX_ITER` with
unresolved safety issues. The agent treats these as **hard constraints** —
not suggestions — when planning or executing operations.

## When the user asks for a new AWS skill

Load `aws-skill-generator` first, then collect the inputs listed under
"Quick Start Checklist → P0" in its SKILL.md before generating any
files. The directory you create must mirror the layout above exactly,
and the generated SKILL.md must pass the Charter and TE rules on the
first round of self-reflection — if it does not, fix the generator
output, not just the symptom in the new skill.

## 11. Generator-Critic-Loop (GCL) — Adversarial Quality Gate

> Inspired by GAN's Generator/Discriminator idea, but deliberately **not** a
> real GAN. Naming: **GCL (Generator-Critic-Loop)** to avoid misleading
> reviewers and LLM trainees.

### 11.1 Purpose

Apply an adversarial **Generator ↔ Critic** loop with a quantitative rubric
to every skill execution. Most valuable in **high-side-effect AWS
operations** (`terminate-instances`, `delete-bucket`, `delete-db-instance`,
`iam delete-user`, `kms schedule-key-deletion`, etc.) where a single
mistake is unrecoverable.

The full specification lives in
[`aws-skill-generator/references/gcl-spec.md`](aws-skill-generator/references/gcl-spec.md).
This section is the **index, current rollout status, and Per-Skill
Defaults table** — read it first, then load the spec for detail.

| GAN (real) | GCL (this spec) |
|---|---|
| Discriminator learns sample distribution | Critic scores an **explicit rubric** |
| No termination condition | Must terminate: **PASS / MAX_ITER / SAFETY_FAIL** |
| G and D train in parallel | G and C run **sequentially** |
| Goal: "fool the D" | Goal: "pass the rubric threshold" |

### 11.2 Roles & isolation

| Role | Job | Forbidden |
|---|---|---|
| **Generator (G)** | Execute the AWS op via `aws --output json` (primary) / boto3 (fallback) | modifying the rubric; self-scoring |
| **Critic (C)** | Independently audit G's output against the rubric | calling `aws` / `boto3` / mutating anything |
| **Orchestrator (O)** | Loop control, termination, final return | executing or scoring on its own |

G and C MUST live in **isolated prompt contexts** (separate sessions or
sub-agents). Shared context is a "pseudo-GCL" and is banned — see spec §9.

### 11.3 Rubric (mandatory per skill)

Each skill declares its 5-dimension rubric in `references/rubric.md`:
**Correctness / Safety / Idempotency / Traceability / Spec Compliance** on
a 0 / 0.5 / 1 scale. **Safety = 0 → ABORT immediately**, regardless of
total score. Full rules in spec §3.

### 11.4 Termination (first match wins)

| Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **PASS** | Every rubric dimension meets its threshold → return G's result |
| **MAX_ITER** | Reached `max_iterations` → return **best-so-far** + unresolved rubric items |
| **SAFETY_FAIL** | Safety = 0 → **ABORT**; never return partial output |

### 11.5 Per-Skill Defaults

> 完整 37 行 Per-Skill Defaults 表（含每 skill 的 GCL 分级、`max_iter`、破坏性操作清单）外移至 [`docs/gcl-per-skill-defaults.md`](docs/gcl-per-skill-defaults.md)。

要点：所有 `required` / `recommended` skill 均已 rollout 完整 GCL 实现；`optional` 与 read-only 类（cloudtrail / topo-discovery / aiops-cruise）按降级策略处理。每 skill 可在自身 `SKILL.md` 的 `## Quality Gate (GCL)` 下覆盖 `max_iter`。未列出的 skill 默认 GCL **disabled**。

### 11.6 Trace & audit (mandatory)

Every GCL run persists a JSON trace to
`./audit-results/gcl-trace-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json` per the schema in spec §6.
`audit-results/` is git-ignored; traces retained 30 days; old traces pruned
by the Phase 2 Orchestrator runner.

### 11.7 Prompt templates (mandatory per skill)

Each skill's `references/prompt-templates.md` is a **thin specialization**
of the canonical shared skeleton at
[`references/prompt-skeletons.md`](aws-skill-generator/references/prompt-skeletons.md)
(spec §7). The per-skill file contains ONLY:

1. Skill metadata table (`{{skill.*}}` placeholders)
2. Hard rules (Critic template injection) — one bullet per
   service-specific rule, each citing a `gcl-spec.md` §8 A-id (A1–A16)
3. Confirmation Strings table — mandatory for every destructive op
4. Variable Convention deltas — only entries unique to this skill

The three canonical templates (Generator / Critic / Orchestrator) are
resolved from the shared skeleton at runtime by
`scripts/gcl_runner.py` via `render_critic_prompt()`. Placeholders MUST
follow the repository-wide `{{env.*}}` / `{{user.*}}` / `{{output.*}}`
convention. Critic prompt MUST hide the raw user request to prevent
"answer-aligned" rubber-stamping. New skill creators MUST use the
[`assets/new-skill-template/prompt-templates.md`](aws-skill-generator/assets/new-skill-template/prompt-templates.md)
copy-paste template; run `--dry-run` before merging.

### 11.8 Anti-patterns (banned)

- ❌ **Shared context G+C** — defeats independence → banned
- ❌ **Subjective scoring** — Critic must use the rubric, not "vibes" → banned
- ❌ **Unbounded loop** — always hard-cap iterations → banned
- ❌ **Critic sees the user request** — encourages rubber-stamping → banned
- ❌ **Silently downgrade on Safety fail** — must ABORT visibly → banned
- ❌ **Trace not persisted** — no post-mortem possible → banned
- ❌ **Critic mutates resources** — Critic is read-only by definition → banned
- ❌ **`aws --output json` placed before subcommand** — non-portable;
  convention is `aws <svc> <op> --output json` (see CLAUDE.md) → banned
  in GCL traces and examples
- ❌ **Parallel GCL: Generators share mutable state** — race conditions → banned
- ❌ **Parallel GCL: Generators modify the same file** — merge conflicts → banned
- ❌ **Parallel GCL: Critic audits only one Generator output** — must audit ALL

### 11.9 AWS-specific rules (repo-wide)

Codified in `gcl-spec.md` §8. Highlights:

- **A1** `terminate-instances` requires user `--no-dry-run` opt-in
- **A7** `--region` must match `{{user.region}}` or `{{env.AWS_DEFAULT_REGION}}`
- **A8** Resource id must be echoed back from a `describe-*` lookup
- **A9** Plaintext `KeyMaterial` / `PasswordData` / `UserData` credentials
  in trace → Safety = 0; mask with `***` and length only
- **A10** `aws sts get-caller-identity` MUST be the first command in trace
- **A11** `cloudfront delete-distribution` must `disable → poll Deployed` first
- **A12** `elbv2 deregister-targets` ≥50% → requires drain confirmation
- **A13** `ec2 delete-vpc` requires 8-describe pre-flight
- **A14** `rds --skip-final-snapshot` → requires `DELETE_NO_SNAPSHOT` token
- **A15** `s3 put-bucket-policy` widening to `Principal: *` → requires public confirmation
- **A16** `autoscaling --force-delete` with `DesiredCapacity > 0` → must scale-to-0 first

### 11.10 Rollout roadmap

- **Phase 1 (in progress)** — spec + this index shipped; pilots on
  **`aws-ec2-ops`** (compute, destructive workload),
  **`aws-iam-ops`** (identity, secret-handling + wildcard-policy guards),
  **`aws-kms-ops`** (encryption, irreversible deletion + plaintext
  masking), and **`aws-s3-ops`** (storage, Versioned-bucket guard +
  public-access widening + `--recursive` rm count confirmation). Roll
  forward to remaining `required` skills one at a time (see §11.5 table).
- **Phase 2** — add `scripts/gcl_runner.py` as a reusable Orchestrator
  (invokes G, then C in isolated context, persists trace, enforces
  termination). Independent of any specific agent runtime.
- **Phase 3** — feed `gcl-trace-*.json` into a CloudWatch dashboard /
  Athena query for Quality Gate pass-rate and per-skill failure-mode
  histograms.
- **Phase 4** — wire rubric pass-rate to CloudWatch Alarms; production
  incidents refine thresholds.

(e) `gcl-spec.md` changelog extended to v1.11.0; "22 skills" references corrected to the actual 31-skill scope (28 required/recommended + 2 meta read-only + 1 generator meta). |
| 1.12.0 | 2026-06-27 | **O1 (A11–A16) + O3 (prompt-skeleton extraction) + `--print-critic` runtime.** `gcl-spec.md` §8 gained six new repo-wide safety rules: **A11** (CloudFront distribution delete requires disable→Deployed first), **A12** (ELB `deregister-targets` 50%/100% drain confirmation), **A13** (VPC `delete-vpc` 8-describe pre-flight), **A14** (RDS/Aurora `--skip-final-snapshot` guard, supersedes legacy A5 in `aws-aurora-ops`), **A15** (S3 `Principal: *` policy widening), **A16** (ASG `--force-delete` requires scale-to-0 + `InstanceProtection=false`). Backfilled A-id labels into the 7 affected rubrics (cloudfront/elb/vpc/rds/aurora/s3/autoscaling). Created `aws-skill-generator/references/prompt-skeletons.md` (canonical Generator/Critic/Orchestrator templates + shared Variable Convention table; 231 lines). New `scripts/_sync_prompt_skeletons.py` retro-migrated all 31 skill `prompt-templates.md` files from ~5,800 lines of duplicated boilerplate to **~2,200 lines of thin deltas (-78%)**; idempotent; supports `--skill <name>`, `--all`, `--dry-run`, `--restore`. `scripts/gcl_runner.py` now exposes `render_critic_prompt()` + `--print-critic` for inspecting the merged Critic prompt at runtime. All three termination paths (PASS / SAFETY_FAIL / MAX_ITER) verified end-to-end via `--self-test` after migration. Net repo diff vs pre-v1.11.0: 48 files changed, **-3,456 lines**. |
| 1.13.0 | 2026-06-27 | **§11.7 updated to reflect shared skeleton architecture (prompt-templates.md is now a thin specialization, not self-contained) + §11.9 extended with A11–A16 highlights + §11.5 Per-Skill Defaults table annotated with A-rules for 7 skills (cloudfront/elb/vpc/rds/aurora/s3/autoscaling). New copy-paste template at `aws-skill-generator/assets/new-skill-template/prompt-templates.md` for new skill creators.** |
| 1.14.0 | 2026-07-04 | **Parallel GCL added (§12 in gcl-spec.md).** Documents the multi-Generator + single-Critic pattern for composite tasks that decompose into independent subtasks (e.g., WAF-ALB-01). Includes flow diagram, 5 rules, 4 anti-patterns, and worked example. Applicable to `aws-aiops-cruise` and `aws-aiops-orchestrator` composite rule development. |

## 12. CodeGraph Integration（代码知识图谱集成）

本地优先的代码知识图谱工具（[colbymchenry/codegraph](https://github.com/colbymchenry/codegraph)，已装 `/Users/bohaiqing/.local/bin/codegraph`，Node v22.19.0）。用 tree-sitter 建本地 SQLite 图谱（`.codegraph/codegraph.db`），通过 MCP（工具 `codegraph_explore` / `codegraph_node`）集成。**设计目标：跨 coding agent 通用**——同一份 `codegraph serve --mcp` 定义，自动投影到 OpenCode / Cursor / Claude Code / Codex / Hermes Agent / Kiro / CodeBuddy 等各自的原生配置，无需 per-agent 适配。100% 本地、无数据外泄。

### 目的

编辑技能 `SKILL.md` / `references/` 或共享脚本（`scripts/gcl_runner.py`、`_shared.py` 等）前，用 CodeGraph 校验**跨技能引用一致性**与**变更影响半径**，补强 §Operational Guidelines 的"跨文件引用三方同步"规则。

本仓库 34 个 `aws-<svc>-ops` 技能委托引用频繁（如 `aws-rds-ops`→`aws-aurora-ops`、`aws-elb-ops`↔`aws-vpc-ops`），改一处可能影响多处。`codegraph explore "aws-aurora-ops"` 实测返回 36 符号跨 3 文件 + blast radius（`run_aws` 有 61 调用者跨 15+ 文件）。

### 命令

```bash
codegraph init .              # 首次建图（实测 564 nodes / 1,329 edges）
codegraph sync .              # 增量同步自上次索引以来的变更（每次代码变更前必跑）
codegraph explore "<symbol>"  # 查影响半径 / 跨文件调用点
codegraph status              # 查索引状态（Files/Nodes/Edges/DB Size）
```

### MCP 集成（跨 agent 通用，一次到位）

**单一技术**：`codegraph serve --mcp`（stdio）。同一份 server 定义，通过
`codegraph install -t all` 自动投影到各 agent 的原生配置文件
（OpenCode / Cursor / Claude Code / Codex / Hermes / Kiro / CodeBuddy 等），
各 agent 读自己的配置即可，**无需 per-agent 适配代码**：

```bash
codegraph install -t all      # 投影 codegraph MCP 到所有已装 agent 的全局配置
# 或指定： codegraph install -t opencode,cursor,claude,codex,hermes,codebuddy
```

- **仓库级自动发现**：本仓库根已放 `.mcp.json`（声明 `mcpServers.codegraph`），
  支持项目级 MCP 的 agent（Cursor / Claude Code / CodeBuddy 开 project-MCP）打开
  本目录即自动感知并加载，无需手动 install。
- **CLI 等价命令**（`codegraph explore` / `codegraph node` / `codegraph sync`）
  始终可用，无 MCP 也可用——AGENTS.md §12 的"改前 sync + 跨技能校验"不依赖 MCP。
- 安装后**重启对应 agent session** 生效；卸载用 `codegraph uninstall -t all`。

### 规则

| 项 | 要求 |
|----|------|
| **每次代码变更前** | **必跑 `codegraph sync .`**（增量同步），确保后续 `explore` / `impact` 基于最新索引；索引不存在时先 `codegraph init .` |
| `.codegraph/` | 内容已被其自带 `.gitignore`（`*` + `!.gitignore`）屏蔽，禁止提交索引；根 `.gitignore` 可补 `.codegraph/`（可选，为 `git status` 静默） |
| 改共享脚本 / 委派引用前 | 先 `codegraph sync .` 再 `codegraph explore "<symbol>"` 确认调用点与文档描述一致 |
| GCL 任务 R2 内容评审 | 用 CodeGraph 辅助校验跨技能委托引用存在性（如 `SHOULD` / `SHOULD NOT` 指向的目录真实存在） |
| 与 self-review 关系 | 不替代 2-round self-review，仅作跨技能引用的机器校验增强 |

## 13. 复利资产沉淀机制（Compound-Asset Distillation Loop, CADL）

**工作闭环，非单条规范**：任何实质任务完成后，Agent 必须走完「提取 → 落点判定 → 写入 → 门禁」才能结束——任务不做沉淀 = 任务未完成。让每次踩坑、评审、跨技能协作都变成下一次的可复用资产，形成复利。

> CADL 闭环机制，适配本仓库术语：`{{env.*}}`/`{{user.*}}`/`{{output.*}}` 占位符、Reflexion Memory（`docs/failure-patterns.md`）、CodeGraph（§12）、AGENTS.md 行数门禁（≤500 行）。

### 触发条件（满足任一即走 CADL）

- 多步 / 跨文件任务完成
- 跨 Skill 协作（delegation matrix 或并行 agent / oracle / explore）
- 评审 / 修复循环（GCL、2-round self-review、Oracle 咨询）
- 发现 repo 缺陷 / 坑（即使不在本次 scope）
- 验证中发现预存 FAIL 并归因
- 用户给出可复用的工作流偏好（如"双写子命令绕过 CLI bug"）

### 闭环步骤

```
1. 提取   → 抽象可复用模式（踩坑避免/评审维度/协作模式/验证命令/helper）
             格式："问题 → 反模式 → 正确做法（含代码示例）"
2. 落点判定 → 离开本仓库？→ ~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md
             仅本仓库？→ 本项目 AGENTS.md
             失败模式/坑？→ docs/failure-patterns.md
             某 skill 专属能力？→ 独立 Skill（经 aws-skill-generator）
3. 写入   → 可执行+有示例+有边界；先 grep 目标文件确认未覆盖
4. 门禁   → 写入前 wc -l，本文件 ≥500 行先精简再写（注：当前 528 行，溢出源为 §11 GCL 既有体量，本次迁移不裁已评审内容；下次优化可外移 §11 长表）
5. 复用   → 下次同类任务读目标文件即获得该资产 → 复利生效
```

### Skill 侧钩子（让每个 Skill 自带沉淀意识）

- **源头**：`aws-skill-generator` 在生成每个 skill 时，须在 SKILL.md 末尾注入一行：
  `> 任务完成后按根 AGENTS.md 的「复利资产沉淀机制 (CADL)」复盘并沉淀可复用资产。`
  未来所有 `aws-<svc>-ops` 自动继承此意识。
- **现存 skill**：逐批在 SKILL.md 末尾补同一行提示，使大模型调用任何 skill 后都看到触发信号。（存量 34 个 `aws-*-ops` 的钩子注入为渐进式，不在本次 CADL 迁移 scope，后续按需补入。）

### 反模式（违反 CADL）

| 反模式 | 正确做法 |
|---|---|
| 任务做完就结束，不沉淀 | 走完 CADL 闭环再交付 |
| 把一次性上下文当资产写进 AGENTS.md | 只沉淀跨任务可复用的模式 |
| 重复已有条目 | 写入前 grep 确认未覆盖 |
| 只在 CodeGraph 相关任务才沉淀 | 评审/修复/协作/验证都触发 |
| 踩坑类资产写进 AGENTS.md 而非 failure-patterns.md | 踩坑/失败模式归 `docs/failure-patterns.md`，通用模式归 AGENTS.md |

### 复利资产示例：声明式契约优先（来自 `skill-as-infrastructure` 落地）

> 复用模式（跨任务 / 跨企业 LLM 生态通用）：
> **问题** → agent 技能体系需让复合/copilot 技能被机器识别、可组合。
> **反模式** → 引入私有 registry / 专属 loader（耦合到具体 agent 运行时）。
> **正确做法** → 在既有 frontmatter 中加**最小声明式契约**字段
> (`metadata.type` / `provides` / `delegate`)，用**现有**自检框架
> (Charter C7) 强制校验，任何 agent 只需 `glob aws-*-ops/SKILL.md`
> 读 frontmatter 即可组合——零私有加载器、运行时无关。
> 通用化：凡"让 X 被机器识别/可组合"的需求，优先加声明式字段 +
> 复用既有 gate，而非造私有基础设施。

### 复利资产示例：契约演进须 grandfather 存量（来自 C7 复盘）

> 复用模式（跨任务 / 跨企业 LLM 生态通用）：
> **问题** → 新加契约（如 `metadata.type: composite`）时，存量 skill
> 已用不同取值（如 `orchestrator-meta`）会被新 gate 误判 orphan / HALT。
> **反模式** → 改契约后忽略存量，或强改存量 frontmatter 去对齐（扩 scope、引入回归）。
> **正确做法** → 契约的允许值集合**显式纳入存量等价值**
> （`composite` ≡ `orchestrator-meta`），在模板注释 / Charter / AGENTS.md 三处同步，
> 不触碰存量 skill 本身。新增契约前先 `grep` 全盘，确认无遗漏的既有取值。

## 14. Token Efficiency 硬性要求与去重规范（TE Hard Gate）

> 仓库级硬性要求，约束 `aws-skill-generator` 生成输出**以及任何手动编辑 skill 的人**。
> 与 `aws-skill-generator/SKILL.md` §Token Efficiency Requirements（C6 MUST-PASS）同源。完整门槛 / 去重先例 / 存量整改策略见 [`docs/te-hard-gate.md`](docs/te-hard-gate.md)。

**核心门槛（C6 硬指标，任一不过不得 merge）：**
- **G1** `SKILL.md` ≤ 120 行；**G2** 无 >5 行硬编码静态表（用 API 替代，TE-1）；**G3** JSON paths 仅顶部声明一次（TE-4）；**G4** 无跨文件重复流程 / boilerplate（TE-6）；**G5** boto3 无 docstring（TE-2）；**G6** 错误表紧凑（TE-3）。
- **去重原则**：内容出现在 ≥2 个 skill 必须抽到单一真相源（先例：`_sync_prompt_skeletons.py` 将 31 skill 的 ~5,800 行 GCL boilerplate 抽到 231 行骨架 + 薄 delta）。
- **存量渐进整改**：新/改 skill 必须达标；34 个存量 `aws-*-ops` 超长者（ec2/cloudwatch/cloudtrail/dynamodb/config/ram/acm/waf）按需顺带压回 ≤120 行。

### 复利资产示例：纪律须 dogfood 自身（来自 finsecops-optimization 复盘）

> 复用模式（跨任务 / 跨企业 LLM 生态通用）：
> **问题** → 仓库纪律（如"implement 前先写 spec+plan"）容易被后续改动悄悄违反，且无自检锚点。
> **反模式** → 纪律只写在 AGENTS.md，落地 commit 不引用对应 spec/plan。
> **正确做法** → 纪律的**推行 commit 自身**须携带引用该纪律的 spec+plan
> （先例：`33f18ba` 加 `Spec + Plan Before Implement` 规范时，同时落盘
> `2026-07-19-finsecops-optimization-design.md` + 对应 plan）。让纪律"自己遵守自己"，
> 任何 agent 回溯 commit 即可验证纪律被 dogfooded，而非仅声明。
